# Mo News For U Front End
Welcome to Mo News For U! This is the website that I have built using React (along with some other things listed later in this document).
## Viewing the hosted version of my website
The simplest way to view and interact with my website, is to look at the hosted version online.
You can access this at: <https://mo-news-for-u.netlify.com>.
## Running the website locally
### Github
The url for my website's repository on github is <https://github.com/tabal97/fe-mo-news-for-u/>. You can type `git clone https://github.com/tabal97/fe-mo-news-for-u.git` into your terminal when in the file you'd like to download the repository to and that should install it for you there (note you may need to log in with your git hub username and password to complete this process).
You can then open the website using e.g. Visual Studio Code (if you are using VS Code simply type code . in your terminal when in the folder that you've downloaded my repository into.)
### Prerequisites
If you wish to start viewing the project locally, you will need to install all of the approriate node modules so that everything runs smoothly.
You can quickly ensure that you have everything installed using `npm i` in the terminal below, which should install all of the dependencies below, as they are listed in the package.json.
My website makes use of:
- React
- Axios
- @reach/router
and these should all be installed using the above command.
You also will need to ensure that you have node version 11.12.0 or greater (you can check your node version by typing node --version into your terminal).
### Hosting on a local port
Should you wish to run the project locally, having taken the above step to install the appropriate node modules, type npm start into your terminal to begin running the website in your browser.
### Check out my back end(!)
Thanks for taking the time to look at my website. Should you want to have a look at the back end that I am using for my api requests on this website, you can find the hosted version at <https://jsa-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api/> and the git hub repo at <https://github.com/thespacehound/nc-news.git>.
